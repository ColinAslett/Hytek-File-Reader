# Hytek-File-Reader
This program reads through a user inputted Hytek text file from Meet Manager/Team Manager and System out prints all the useful info in the following order:
  Swimmer Name(last,first) , Age , Gender:
    Distance of Event + Stroke: Time and corresponding coruse(Y = Yards)
    
# NOTES:
## THIS WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR HYTEK TEXT FILE CONTAINS SPLITS(if it contains lines starting with G), that feature will be added in the future. Also, if a swimmer was DQ'ed in a event they will have a Q1 flag after their Time.
